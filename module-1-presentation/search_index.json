router and modem connecting to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), except now it has a direct line to other content-serving mesh nodes just like itself, and has superpowers because it runs like a full computer.\n"},"part-3/":{"url":"part-3/","title":"Investigate our technologies","keywords":"","body":"Investigate our technologies\nSelect a popular website or application and investigate based
